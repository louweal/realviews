# Realviews

Integrate Hedera Smart Contracts into your WordPress website to get verifiable reviews. All reviews written using Realviews are stored on the Hedera network, connected to the purchase transaction and signed by the customer using their wallet. Therefore you can be sure that every review is, indeed, [real](https://github.com/louweal/hellofuturehackathon/tree/master/realviews#review-verification).

## Dependencies / Required Plugins

-   [HederaPay](https://github.com/louweal/hellofuturehackathon/tree/master/hederapay#readme) - HederaPay adds all functionality needed to connect to the Hedera network and make payments on Hedera.
-   (OPTIONAL) [Advanced Custom Fields PRO](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/)
    -   If ACF PRO is installed, the plugin adds easy to use Gutenberg blocks (these blocks have the same functionality as the shortcodes).
-   (OPTIONAL) [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/)
    -   If WooCommerce is installed the HederaPay option is added to the Payment options in the WooCommerce check-out and a Reviews section is added to the product pages.

## Installation

Install [HederaPay](https://github.com/louweal/hellofuturehackathon/tree/master/hederapay#readme) if not yet installed. Then download the [realviews.zip](https://github.com/louweal/hellofuturehackathon/blob/master/realviews.zip) file from the root of this repository. Go to the `WP dashboard` **>** `Plugins`. Click `Add New Plugin` **>** `Upload Plugin` and upload the downloaded zipfile. This will upload and install the plugin, next click `Activate` to activate the plugin.

## Configuration for WooCommerce shops _(optional)_

On the Realviews admin page you can select the number of reviews you want to show on a product page and set the button text for showing more reviews (if available). This button triggers a modal showing all reviews. Set the number of reviews to `-1` to show all reviews in-page.

> Set the number of reviews to `0` to hide the whole review section.

## Shortcodes

### [hederapay_transaction_button]

Realviews adds attribute `store` to the Hederapay transaction button that allows you to save the transaction IDs to the page metadata such that they can be used to enable reviewing on that page.

| Attribute          | Description                                            | Default value |

### [realviews_latest_reviews]

Retrieves all reviews for the current product/page from the Hedera Mirror [REST API](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/sdks-and-apis/rest-api).

> The reviews have a small badge in the top right corner when they are from the `testnet` or `previewnet` network.

#### Attributes

| Attribute   | Description                                       | Default value |

| max_reviews | Maximum number of reviews to show on product page | 2             |
| button_text | Button text for showing all reviews               | All reviews   |

#### Gutenberg block

On websites with Gutenberg (WordPress version >= 5.0) and [Advanced Custom Fields PRO](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/) you can use the _Latest Reviews (Realviews)_-Gutenberg block instead of the shortcode. The functionality and output are the same as the shortcode.

### [realviews_num_reviews]

Displays the total number of reviews for the current product/page.

## Review verification

All reviews written using Realviews are stored on the Hedera network, connected to the purchase transaction and signed by the customer using their wallet. Therefore you can be sure that every review is, indeed, **real**.

### Inspecting transaction data

The following two steps allow everyone to check the raw transaction data on Hedera to verify the review.

**Step 1**  
Click on the review date of the review you wish to inspect. This brings up the raw transaction data on the Hedera Mirrornode. Look for the encoded string inside `"logs"`**>**`"data"` and copy it.  
**Step 2**  
Ask [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) to decode it.

> **Example**:  
> `decode without explanation: 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`

ChatGPT will respond with the decoded string.

> **Example**:  
> `{"transactionId":"0.0.4505361-1723976981-714805374","rating":5,"name":"Alex M.","message":"This track is a banger! The energy is off the chartsâ€”perfect for getting pumped up before a night out."}`

**Step 3** (optional)  
If you also want to inspect the buy transaction connected to this review, you can simply copy the `transactionId` from ChatGPT and look it up using a Network Inspector such as [Hashscan](https://hashscan.io/).

> Tip: Make sure you select the right network in the network inspector.
